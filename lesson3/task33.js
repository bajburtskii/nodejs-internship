/**
 * Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
 *
 * Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
 *
 * All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
 *
 * @example:
 *    Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
 *    Output: true
 *
 *  @example:
 *    Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
 *    Output: false
 *
 *  @example:
 *    Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
 *    Output: true
