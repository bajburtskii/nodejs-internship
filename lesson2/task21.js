/**
 * Write a JavaScript program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.
 *
 * C = (5/9) * (F - 32)
 *
 * The results from C to F have to be available in Global Scope, and results from F to C have to be available only in a local scope.
 *
 * Please support your code with detailed comments answering the question `Why`, rather than `What`.
 *
 * Sample Output:
 *    60째C is 140 째F.
 *    45째F is 7.222222222222222째C.
